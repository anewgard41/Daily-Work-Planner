# Daily-Work-Planner

## Organize your workday with this easy to use planner! 

This assignment had us tackle 3rd Party APIs. Last week we used integrated web APIs included in the browser and JS. This week, we used jQuery, dayJS, and bootstrap to make a DOM element that is dynamically rendered based on the time of day. 

Here's the link to the deployed application: https://anewgard41.github.io/Daily-Work-Planner/

Above is a demo of the planner, and below you'll find the User Story and Acceptance Criteria for the assignment. 

```
User Story
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```
```
Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours of 9am to 5pm
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

## Credits 
Wanted to give a massive shout out to my tutor this week, Eric Sayer. He helped guide me through writing the for loops necessary to dynamically apply the class selectors to the appropriate DOM elements. 

Thanks for reading! Enjoy!
